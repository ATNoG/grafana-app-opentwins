# Digital twins plugin for Eclipse Ditto

Plugin for grafana that allows the management of **digital twins** stored in Eclipse Ditto. It also supports Eclipse Hono for device connection.

It allows you to view, create, delete and edit digital twins and their components (things). It also gives the option to create a device entity in a Hono tenant along with its credentials. Moreover, the ditto-extended-api service is also required. This allows the abstraction of types, both twins and things, and allows adding more information to the twin entity.

It is essential to fill in the Config tab before using the plugin.
